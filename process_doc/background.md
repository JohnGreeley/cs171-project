# W3C - Test the Web Forward
** by Jennifer Le Hegaret, Zona Kostic, and John Greeley **

## Section 1 - Background and Objectives

* proceed to Section 2, The Data *

For our project, we propose to assist the W3C in its work to develop the standards for the web platform by helping it visualize its progress developing and testing its various specifications for web standards.

### W3C Background

W3C works on a huge number of specs.  What we think of as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is splintered across all of these various documents.  Browser developers use these documents to know how to build their browsers, and we students use them to learn how to write our code so that it will work in the browswers.

Each spec is shepherded along by at least one "working group".  As the ideas in each spec are more and more universally adopted by the various browser vendors (due to the spec changing to reflect market reality as well as enough browsers "catching up" to the spec), the spec moves along from "draft" to "recommendation."  A spec's attainment of "Recommendation" status is what really moves the web forward, as developers everywhere then have a firm and universal bedrock upon which to build.

### Team Background and Motivation

Jennifer has personal connections with W3C and so offered that organization the chance to take advantage of some pro-bono labor via the CS 171 project.  Together, they decided that the best data to work with would be the data related to progress made on the Specification drafts and Test Suite, as measured by both W3C GitHub activity and CanIUse.com statuses.  This work will be very useful for W3C in terms of understanding what its working groups are actually working on and number of current to-do items which need to be addressed.   The work is also very well-suited for this project due to the public availability of the data and the numerous data dimensions that are ripe for exploration and presentation.

Zona was happy to join Jennifer on this project as she has great respect for W3C and its work, and she wants to dedicate her efforts to a project with real-world applicability and relevance.

John was drawn to their team as he had previously worked with a government contractor to research and implement web services standards for cross-agency integration projects.  He is therefore familiar with W3C standards and also willing to help support W3C’s work through his CS 171 project.

### Project Objectives

We aim to help the W3C monitor what has been done and what needs to be done across all of the GitHub repositories that it uses to develop and to test its specs.

We are going to help monitor three forces that help move a spec to "Recommendation" status:
- how many JavaScript tests have been written for that spec
- how many edits the spec itself has received
- what does caniuse.com have to say about the implementation of the features in the spec

We aim to provide different views of the status of various pull requests and raised issues by working group, by spec, and by who is contributing.  We would also like to incorporate available CanIUse.com data as a barometer measuring a given spec’s implementation level.

In this way, we hope to help W3C and other interested parties are able to “Test the Web Forward” as effectively as possible.  If we succeed in creating something truly useful to them, they will use it on their website:  www.testthewebforward.org/dashboard.
