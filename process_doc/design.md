# Section 4 - Our Design Process

* *return to [Section 3, What W3C Has So Far](existing.md)*
* *proceed to [Section 5, Our Proposed Feature Set](proposal.md)*

## First, Jennifer's very rough ideas

(will embed those rough sketches, with some notes as to thoughts)

## Then, Zona's wonderful proposal

( How did you do it?? )

(embedding the same images as in our proposal)

( And then a bit more discussion why you decided to stick with the first picture and not pursue the "gauge-like" diagrams in the upper left of your second figure. )

## And more details, based on our discussion in the Science Center Library's study room

(Jennifer will try to add this based on her notes.)
