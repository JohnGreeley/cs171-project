# Section 4 - Our Design Process

* return to Section 3,  *
* proceed to Section 5, *

First, Jennifer's very rough ideas

(will embed those rough sketches, with some notes as to thoughts)

Then, Zona's wonderful proposal

( How did you do it?? )

(embedding the same images as in our proposal)

( And then a bit more discussion why you decided to stick with the first picture and not pursue the "gauge-like" diagrams in the upper left of your second figure. )
