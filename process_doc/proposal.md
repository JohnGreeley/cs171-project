# Section 5 - Our Proposed Feature Set

* return to Section 4,  *
* proceed to Section 6, *

## Must-Have Features

At a minimum, we need to present the same information that is currently presented at the www.testthewebforward.org/dashboard website, but including Specification information and a sense of the CanIUse data as well as the Test Suite information which is already there.  W3C wants to be able to judge progress over time primarily, and immediate action items secondarily.

Also, easier navigation between views of different levels is necessary:  overall, by working group, and by spec within working group.  Right now, there is just a very long, esoteric and jumbled pull-down menu to switch between different specs and groups.

## Optional Features

We very much want to provide a lot of interaction, so that the navigation between views is a matter of clicking and zooming, all the way to specific GitHub issues or CanIUse pages if desired, even while we provide a sleek overview of the current amount of work to be done.

We would also like to provide a sense of overall timelines about which issues have been outstanding for how long, or how long it has been since a spec’s last published date as compared to its last GitHub update, etc.

Also, we hope to offer a view about “who” is doing what over time, given that this data is also available and interesting.
