## Proposal

As we imagined our Visualization, these are the goals that we set ourselves:

### Must-Have Features

At a minimum, we wanted to present the same information that is currently presented at [www.testthewebforward.org/dashboard](www.testthewebforward.org/dashboard), but including Specification information and a sense of the CanIUse data as well as the Test Suite information which is already there.

Also, we wanted to provide easier navigation between views of the different levels (work done overall, by working group, and by spec within working group).  At the current website, there is just a very long, esoteric and jumbled pull-down menu to switch between different specs and groups.

### Optional Features

We very much wanted to provide a lot of interaction, so that the navigation between views is a matter of clicking and zooming, all the way to specific GitHub issues or CanIUse pages if desired, even while we provide a sleek overview of the current amount of work to be done.

We also aimed to provide a sense of overall timelines about which issues have been outstanding for how long, or how long it has been since a spec’s last published date as compared to its last GitHub update, etc.

Also, we hoped to offer a view about “who” is doing what over time, given that this data is also available and interesting.

## Reality

Of the Must-Have Features, we successfully implemented:

[ to do, and why not for any we missed ]

Of the Optional Features, we successfully implmented:

In addition to the items we had first imagined, we also managed to:
