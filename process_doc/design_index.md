## The Dashboard Itself

One thing to note, which has been helpful during our design decisions, is that we can be sure that our users will in general be viewing our website on extremely large monitor screens, with the occasional laptop-only usage.  Our users are computer programmers by trade and will have all the productivity-enhancing hardware available.  We do not have to worry about supporting mobile.

As we began work, we at first stuck closely to look of the [website](www.testthewebforward/dashboard) that we may eventually replace:
