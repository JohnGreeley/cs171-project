## The Dashboard Itself

One thing to note, which has been helpful during our design decisions, is that we can be sure that our users will in general be viewing our website on extremely large monitor screens, with the occasional laptop-only usage.  Our users are computer programmers by trade and will have all the productivity-enhancing hardware available.  We do not have to worry about supporting mobile.

As we began work, we at first stuck closely to look of the [website](www.testthewebforward/dashboard) that we may eventually replace:

</p>

However, by the time that we met with our TF (or "marker"), we had dared to go a bit more "infovis" style, towards Zona's vision:

</p>

Once the fundamental graphs were in place, Zona was able to spend some time further improving the overall look while Jennifer re-consolidated the timeline in anticipation of taking advantage of the "focus and context" axis recommended by our TF:

    <img src="images/Index3.png" width="600"/>
</p>


As we continued work on each visualization within the pages, improving focus capabilities and adding descriptive text and legends, the dashboard finally looked like:
