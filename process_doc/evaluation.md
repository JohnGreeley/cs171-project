# Section 8- Self-Evaluation

*return to [Section 7, Interesting Discoveries](discoveries.md)*

This visualization reaches our goal and then some.  While we did not have time for everything we imagined as we created it, we did manage to implement a very ambitious hope.  Zona's visionary skills , John's programming expertise, and Jennifer's jack-of-all-trades project management made a wonderfully complementary team.  We hope that you, too, are pleased with the results.

Of course, there are always more ideas.  From the fundamental to the extreme, here are some of the types of things left on the to-do list:

- simplify the presentation further via use of fisheyes and by collapsing the menu
- add many more tooltips, full of expanding lists of links to the specific GitHub pages.  While our sunburst provides this access, the Contributors list and Timeline could also provide direct access to the data underneath.  We could also expand the text for the Sunburst tooltips.  Also, behavior-wise, the tooltips need to be more clickable - sometimes the sunburst ones skitter away from the mouse as new areas with new tooltips come into focus.
- get more data - we could incorporate commits for the test suite, improve the quality of the entries in the Contributors list (sometimes people are listed twice, sometimes an issue closer was "unknown").  And maybe someday this could tie into the actual W3 test suites to generate implementation scores per spec, rather than using CanIUse data.
- add more detail to the Contributors List bars, so that we see how much work within each category a given person produces, rather than the "code vs. issues" simplification.
- add an alternate view of the timeline so that we can see the amount of work done for various specs over time by a particular working group, rather than the different types of work across time for all the specs by that working group.
- evaluate if a network graph might add value.  Currently, we can see how many working groups one individual is involved with via the sunburst, and we can judge how involved an individual is via the Contributors list as well as with the timeline, so perhaps it is not needed.  On the other hand, they are a lot of fun to look at!

Thank you for sharing our journey to create this Visualization.  We hope that you enjoy it.
