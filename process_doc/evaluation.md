# Section 8- Evaluation

*return to [Section 7, Interesting Discoveries](discoveries.md)*

TBD

What We Would Want to Add

Network Graph to see who's most connected
Way to see work done on different specs over time on timeline all at once, rather than just type of work on timeline all at once
Tooltips to Who
Stacked Bars in Who to see what kind of work done per person, or which specs per person
Commits for test suite as well
Make sure to get all contributors' names properly, and know both versions (full name vs. login) so as to consolidate appropriately
Incorporate results from actual test-suite, not just CanIUse data
